# Roommate & Rental Matching Platform 

---

## Project Overview

The **Roommate & Rental Matching Platform** is a comprehensive web application aimed at helping tenants and property owners connect efficiently. It facilitates finding suitable roommates and rental properties based on detailed user preferences like budget, gender, lifestyle habits, and location.

This platform supports:
- User management for tenants and owners with secure authentication.
- Property listing management including adding, editing, deleting, and browsing available rentals.
- Tenants specifying detailed roommate preferences such as smoking habits, pets, cleanliness, sleep schedules, and rent ranges.
- Sending and managing rental or roommate requests, with accept/reject workflows.
- A rating and review system to maintain trustworthy connections.
- Compatibility scoring and matching algorithm that recommends the best roommate or property fits.

## Objectives

- Design and implement a normalized MySQL database with proper foreign keys and constraints.
- Develop a dynamic PHP backend integrating CRUD operations, joins, triggers, and stored procedures.
- Implement a clean, user-friendly frontend with HTML/CSS for seamless interaction.
- Enable filtering and advanced matching through SQL queries.
- Provide a full request management and rating system to encourage reliable connections.

## Database Tables Overview

Our project database consists of the following main tables:

- **users:** Stores user information such as name, email, hashed password, age, gender, role (tenant/owner), and contact details.

- **properties:** Contains rental listings posted by owners including title, description, address, location, rent, availability, gender preference, amenities, and status.

- **preferences:** Tenant roommate preferences including budget range, pets allowed, smoking habits, cleanliness level, sleep schedule, preferred location, and gender preference.

- **requests:** Rental connection requests sent by tenants to property owners, including messages and status tracking (pending, accepted, rejected).

- **roommate_requests:** Requests between tenants to connect as roommates, including status and timestamps.

- **ratings:** Stores ratings and comments given by users after stays, capturing reviewer, reviewed user, rating score, and review date.

These tables are related through foreign keys ensuring data integrity and supporting complex queries for matching and filtering.
